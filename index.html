          <h1>HELLO!</h1>

            We are more than your normal coffee shop; we are a <br />
            part of your everyday lives. Our passion and love of <br />
            home-cooked meal is portrayed in every dish we <br />
            serve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Come and choose from our heartily and healthy all <br />
            day brunch, sexy salads or good old fashioned <br />
            specials with a taste of Persia. We have excellent <br />
            coffee, speciality teas and an array of freshly <br />
            pressed juices and smoothies. And last but by far not <br />
            the least, we have freshly baked cakes which will put <br />
            a smile on your face.

          <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
          <p>
            I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs
            after deciding to give up my 9 to 5 job in the city. With no
            catering experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business
            was NOT to look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and
            all the customers were guests in my home. <br />
            <br />

            After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not
            yet learnt the art of the business but have mastered the art of
            being a host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook the food I
            serve to my family at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site and
            served immediately to our guests.
